# Magic Script XR SDK Sample

This is a sample project that renders persistent Anchors on Android and iOS using the XR SDK.

For details on how to set up this sample from an initial magic-script project template (as create by
the magic-script CLI), see https://github.com/magic-script/react-native-xr-client.

## Setup, Build and Run the XR SDK sample app

1. Make sure you have the [`magic-script-cli`](https://github.com/magic-script/magic-script-cli) installed and you follow the steps in `magic-script-cli` documentation to properly setup your environment for either `iOS` or `Android` (depending on which platform you want to build the project for)

2. To build & run the project, execute below commands in root directory of the project:

     - For Android, type `magic-script build android`
     - For iOS, type `magic-script build iOS`
